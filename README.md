Remake of this site here (still work in progress): https://gcunningham178.github.io/unix_tutorial_remake/index.html


Freshman-year individual project in which I had to implement what I learned about front-end web development. The theme was a unix tutorial.
Created banner using Adobe Photoshop. Remake of this site can be found via link above, which reflects my current level of skill in web development
