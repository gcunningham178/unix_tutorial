# unix_tutorial
Freshman-year individual project in which I had to implement what I learned about front-end web development. The theme was a unix tutorial.
Created banner using Adobe Photoshop. Working on improving site to match my current level of knowledge. To view current level of skill, see my resume website 

Remake of this site will be posted in early April 2018 as UNIX-ify!
