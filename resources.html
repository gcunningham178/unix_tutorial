<button id="resources1">Designing the Navigation</button>
<div id="exp1" style="display: none">
    <h2>Designing the Navigation</h2>
<p>This site was designed to teach people how to use Unix. Therefore, I did my best to accomodate any inconvenient scenarios that
I could possibly think of. For instance, the navigation was one of the most crucial components of my web site. I designed it to facilitate
navigation for the user, making it easier to venture through my site without getting lost. Since there are over twenty pages within my web
site, I did not endeavor to include all of them in my main navigation. Instead, I grouped the pages of the commands according to their function
in Unix and named their groups as such. That way, the navigation can serve in one of a few ways: help a user who is already familiar with
Unix find a certain command or give a beginner user a preview of how a command works before reading about it on its respective page. To
further explain my point, here's a scenario that I had in mind when designing the navigation. Suppose a user wanted to know how to move files
from one directory to another using Unix. How might this user be able to accomplish this quickly and easily on my web site? One of my links
on my global navigation bar is called <em>Working with Files</em>. This will narrow down the search for the user and cause less frustration with
the search. People most likely would not want to spend all of their time looking for one thing. Thus, the design of my navigation solves this
problem and a few more that users might encounter on other web sites.</p>
</div>


<button id="resources2">Special Features of the Site</button>
<div id="exp2" style="display: none">
    <h2>Special Features</h2>
<p>While putting this site together, I had a general idea of how the design might look. However, I wanted to enhance the design for the sake of my audience.
First, I grouped pages together and created drop-down menus for those groups using advanced CSS skills. Second, I created the banner of my site from scratch
using Photoshop. I've had some experience with Photoshop prior to college, which contributed to my success in that respect. Third, I used CSS3 features, such as
text-shadow, box-shadow, border-radius, and gradient color schemes. As you look through my site, you will see the consistency in my usage of these features.
Finally, I used Javascript to perform actions when my buttons are clicked. These buttons can be found at the bottom of the table of contents section of the command
pages. When the buttons are clicked, a prompt will appear for the user to input an answer. An alert message will appear to inform the user
whether or not his or her answer is correct. The idea of these buttons is to test the knowledge of the user to make sure that he or she
understands how the commands work after looking at this site. After all, the purpose of this site is to teach my audience how to effectively use Unix and understand the commands.</p>
</div>

<button id="resources3">Chunking the Content</button>
<div id="exp3" style="display: none">
<h2>Chunking the Content</h2>

<p>A very significant part of this web site is the content. If the content is not meaningful, it renders the web site useless. With this fact in
mind, I organized and implemented content that will serve its purpose. As I mentioned previously, I grouped the commands according to their functions. That way, the user will
not encounter any problems finding the commands. With each command, I attempted to explain their functions to the best of my ability. It is important that I am able to accomodate
to the needs of my user. Therefore, I tried discussing the commands as if I were actually teaching a class. I wanted to be straightforward with my clarifications and make things less
complicated for my audience. I accomplished this by discussing the functions of the commands and providing scenarios in which they might be needed. Any other advanced concepts that related to
the commands were explained thoroughly. I even provided the syntax and applied example for most of the commands.</p>
</div>

<button id="resources4">Use of HTML and CSS</button>
<div id="exp4" style="display: none">
    <h2>Use of HTML and CSS: Behind the Scenes</h2>
<p>Designing the web site ran smoothly. First, I started off with the basic design---or <em>skeleton</em> of the page if you will. I had plain colors for my background to begin with, and
all elements were in <em>boxes</em>. Needless to say, this helped me place my content on the page. After I gathered my content on the page, it was time to <em>put the meat on the skeleton</em>. This
is where i used advanced CSS. After grouping the command pages, I used the groups as the basis of my drop-down menus. Second, I <em>unboxed</em> the headers and added a border radius to each,
making them more dynamic. As far as positioning goes, I separated the content area, navigation, table of contents, and banner into individual <em>div</em> boxes. I kept the
content area to the right, while floating the table of contents to the left. And of course the navigation bar and banner remained at the top of the page. I also made sure that I gave them fixed widths
to avoid the text moving around when the browser is resized. Finally, the skin of the skeleton is pretty much the CSS3 features that I mentioned initially and the banner that I created.</p>

<h2>What's New? The Use of Advanced Javascript and JQuery</h2>

<p>The major difference between this website and the one designed for my midterm project is that there is more interactivity. This was
accomplished using advanced Javascript and JQuery. The Javascript that I used can really be noticed in the final quiz section of the website.
While this website still contains the quick quizzes on certain pages, I included the final quiz as its own page to summarize the content and
test the knowledge of the user. At the end of the quiz, the user will be notified via alert box of how many questions they have correct out
of ten. What's also new is that I threw in some multiple choice. Javascript is used to validate each answer.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the navigation bar runs more smoothly than that of the last website. This was done using advanced CSS properties that allowed
for smooth transitions from the main menu to the submenus. </p>
<p>Moreover, I used JQuery in a variety of places. For instance, clicking on the buttons above the first paragraph of this section will fade in
other sections on this page. You can even fade these sections back out again if you wish. Secondly, if you hover over the paragraphs, the phrases
or words emphasized in italics will have different CSS properties than other words around them. Also, at the bottom of the main pages, such as <em>Working
With Files, Directory Commands, and Keeping Tabs</em>, you will be prompted to click on a reddish section. This will slide down the commands that will
be discussed in each section of the website. Thus, JQuery was used to create interactivity in these cases.</p>
